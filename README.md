The first papter, entitled "Master's Research Paper", is a extensive 40 page paper, with over 200 citations, that demonstrates my ability to both research and present complex material.

The second paper, called "Report" showcases my ability to research vast amounts of data using data visualization software such as Tableau, Google Fusion, Indiemapper, and Geocommons.org in order to create an easily readable data report.
